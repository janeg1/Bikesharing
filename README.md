Most importantly we can conclude that the most profit bike sharing business brings is during work day by male subscribers who travel to work 5-7 mins in the radius of 1-2 miles. Other less profitable part is customers on a weekend, who cruise for pleasure. In order to determine if business would succeed in any other city or town is to analyze transportation, mainly in business district or if town has tourist area that gets heavy traffic on a weekend and can be enjoyed by riding a bike, say along the water or long main street.
